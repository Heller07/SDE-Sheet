// Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree as each node of the binary tree is visited exactly once.

// Space Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because the recursive stack uses an auxiliary space which can potentially hold all nodes in the tree when dealing with a skewed tree (all nodes have only one child), consuming space proportional to the number of nodes.In the average case or for a balanced tree, the maximum number of nodes that could be in the stack at any given time would be roughly the height of the tree hence O(log2N
