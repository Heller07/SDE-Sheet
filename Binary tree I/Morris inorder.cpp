// Time Complexity: O(2N) where N is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree.

// The time complexity is linear, as each node is visited at most twice (once for establishing the temporary link and once for reverting it).
// In each step, we perform constant-time operations, such as moving to the left or right child and updating pointers.
// Space Complexity: O(1) The space complexity is constant, as the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space irrespective of the input size.

// Morris Traversal does not use any additional data structures like stacks or recursion, making it an in-place algorithm.
// The only space utilised is for a few auxiliary variables, such as pointers to current and in-order predecessor nodes.
