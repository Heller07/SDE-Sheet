// Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree. This complexity arises from visiting each node exactly once during the traversal and the function compares the nodes in a symmetric manner.

// Space Complexity: O(1) as no additional data structures or memory is allocated.

// O(H): Recursive Stack Space is used to calculate the height of the tree at each node which is proportional to the height of the tree.
// The recursive nature of the getHeight function, which incurs space on the call stack for each recursive call until it reaches the leaf nodes or the height of the tree.
